              Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men. This year,<br/> an
              estimated 191,930 men in the United States will be diagnosed with
              prostate cancer. Around 60% of cases are diagnosed in men over 65.
              The average age of diagnosis is 66 years. The disease rarely
              occurs in those younger than 40. The number of new cases diagnosed
              in black men is 60% higher than the number of new cases diagnosed
              in white men.

              Most prostate cancers (90%) are found when the disease is in only
              the prostate and nearby organs. This is referred to as the local
              or regional stage.
