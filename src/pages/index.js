                Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men. This year,
                an estimated 191,930 men in the United States will be diagnosed
                with prostate cancer. Around 60% of cases are diagnosed in men
                over 65. The average age of diagnosis is 66 years. The disease
                rarely occurs in those younger than 40. The number of new cases
                diagnosed in black men is 60% higher than the number of new
                cases diagnosed in white men.
              </p>

              <p>
                Most prostate cancers (90%) are found when the disease is in
                only the prostate and nearby organs. This is referred to as the
                local or regional stage. Median age at diagnosis was 68 years.

                swelling.
